# B2B AI Marketplace - Project Scratchpad â˜•

## Project Overview
**Transformation:** Converting existing B2C ecommerce template into sophisticated B2B AI-powered negotiation marketplace

**Vision:** A marketplace where suppliers and buyers never directly negotiate - instead, AI agents handle complex commercial negotiations on their behalf, finding optimal compromises automatically.

## Current Status

**ðŸŽ¯ CURRENT PRIORITY: Products API Integration** ðŸš€

**Major Task:** Integrate with external API to replace all existing product data with real industrial products

**API Integration Details:**
- **External API**: `web-u7lq49qv2x24.up-de-fra1-k8s-1.apps.run-on-seenode.com/api/featuredProducts?buyer_id=1`
- **MVP Approach**: Always use `buyer_id=1` for now
- **Response Structure**: Nested arrays for excavators and aluminum sheets
- **Development Challenge**: Cannot test API during development (no web-u7lq49qv2x24.up-de-fra1-k8s-1.apps.run-on-seenode.com)
- **Image Strategy**: Random assignment until API provides images

**User Requirements:**
- Complete removal of old B2C products (t-shirts, etc.)
- Integration with real external API data
- Graceful handling of API unavailability
- Random assignment of existing product images
- Heterogeneous attribute handling across different product types

**ðŸŽ¯ COMPLETED: Dynamic Product Description System** âœ…

**Major Achievement:** Successfully implemented flexible, data-driven product description system that adapts to diverse product types (excavators, aluminum sheets, and B2C products)

## Current Task: Negotiation Flow UX Fixes

### Background & Motivation
The negotiation flow has been implemented but several critical UX issues have been identified that impact user experience and functionality. These need immediate attention to ensure smooth user journey.

### Key Issues Analysis

#### 1. Checkbox Visibility Issue
- **Problem**: "Apply your standard terms" checkbox is invisible
- **Impact**: Users cannot see or interact with important setting
- **Root Cause**: Likely CSS styling issue with checkbox visibility
- **Solution**: Fix checkbox styling to ensure visibility and proper interaction

#### 2. Voice Flow Logic Issue
- **Problem**: After voice recording, users still see step 2 (text input)
- **Impact**: Redundant step creates confusion and poor UX
- **Root Cause**: Step progression logic doesn't account for voice input completion
- **Solution**: Modify flow to skip step 2 when voice recording is completed

#### 3. Button Color Consistency Issue
- **Problem**: Edit button hover color doesn't match company color scheme
- **Impact**: Inconsistent visual experience, breaks brand consistency
- **Root Cause**: Button hover states not updated with new color scheme
- **Solution**: Update all button hover states to use company colors

#### 4. Debug Feature Request
- **Problem**: No way to access recorded .wav files for debugging
- **Impact**: Difficult to debug voice recording issues
- **Solution**: Add download functionality for recorded audio files

### Target User Experience Improvements
```
Improved User Journey:
1. Click microphone â†’ "Tell us what product you need..." âœ…
2. Speak request â†’ See transcription â†’ AUTO-SKIP to step 3 (NEW)
3. Review parsed requirements â†’ Edit with proper hover colors â†’ Proceed
4. Watch AI negotiation progress â†’ "Your agent is negotiating..." âœ…
5. Review negotiated deals â†’ Approve/decline â†’ Complete âœ…

Additional: Debug audio download available for troubleshooting
```

## Key Innovation Points
1. **AI Agent Negotiation:** Buyer and seller agents negotiate autonomously âœ…
2. **Voice-First Interface:** Speech input for product requests and commercial terms âœ…
3. **Real-time Negotiation Visualization:** Users watch agents negotiate as loading screen âœ…
4. **No Direct Negotiation:** Users can only accept/reject final negotiated contracts âœ…
5. **Persistent Buy Alerts:** Standing orders that auto-negotiate when matches appear
6. **Smart Industrial Filters:** Advanced filtering for industrial product specifications âœ…

## Technical Architecture Decisions
- **Frontend:** Next.js (existing) + Real-time WebSocket connections
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express API + Python AI services
