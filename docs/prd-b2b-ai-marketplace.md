# PRD: B2B AI-Powered Negotiation Marketplace

## Executive Summary

**Product Vision:** A revolutionary B2B marketplace where AI agents autonomously negotiate complex commercial transactions on behalf of buyers and suppliers, eliminating traditional time-consuming negotiation processes while achieving optimal outcomes for all parties.

**Core Innovation:** Instead of humans spending days or weeks negotiating contracts, AI agents representing buyers and suppliers negotiate in real-time while users watch the process unfold. Users can only accept or reject the final negotiated contract - no direct negotiation allowed.

**Target Market:** B2B companies seeking efficient procurement and sales processes, particularly those dealing with standardized products, commodities, or services where negotiation parameters can be clearly defined.

## Problem Statement

3. **Suboptimal Outcomes:** Human negotiators may miss optimal compromise points
4. **Inconsistent Processes:** Each negotiation follows different patterns and timelines
5. **Resource Intensive:** Requires dedicated procurement teams and relationship managers

### Market Opportunity
