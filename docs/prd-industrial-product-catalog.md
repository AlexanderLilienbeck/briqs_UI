# PRD: Industrial Product Catalog Enhancement

## Executive Summary

Transform the B2B AI marketplace's generic product catalog into a comprehensive industrial product showcase featuring 20 realistic industrial products with sophisticated negotiation variables and smart filtering capabilities. This enhancement will demonstrate the platform's capability to handle complex B2B scenarios across multiple industrial sectors.

## Problem Statement

### Current Limitations
1. **Generic Products**: Current catalog contains placeholder products that don't reflect real B2B complexity
2. **Simple Negotiations**: Limited negotiation variables that don't showcase AI agent capabilities
3. **Basic Filtering**: Insufficient filtering for industrial product specifications
4. **Unrealistic Scenarios**: Products don't represent actual industrial procurement challenges

### Business Impact
- **Demo Limitations**: Difficult to showcase platform value to industrial prospects
- **User Engagement**: Generic products don't resonate with B2B industrial buyers
- **AI Showcase**: Simple products don't demonstrate sophisticated negotiation capabilities
- **Market Positioning**: Platform appears more suited for simple B2C than complex B2B

## Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
